### **CNI**
Container Network Interface. Plugins that manage networking for containers and pods.

ðŸ“˜ [CNI Plugins â€“ GitHub](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins)

---

### **OpenShift**
An enterprise Kubernetes distribution by Red Hat that includes additional tooling for developers, security, and operations.

ðŸ“˜ [What is OpenShift? â€“ Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift)

---

### **OKD**
The open-source upstream version of OpenShift, community-maintained.

ðŸ“˜ [OKD â€“ Official Site](https://www.okd.io/)

---

### **Operator**
A method of packaging, deploying, and managing Kubernetes applications using custom resources and controllers.

ðŸ“˜ [Operators â€“ OpenShift Docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/operators/understanding/olm-what-operators-are.html)

---

### **Helm**
A package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies deployment of applications using charts (templated YAMLs).

ðŸ“˜ [Helm â€“ Official Site](https://helm.sh/)

### **Master Node**
A node that hosts the Kubernetes control plane components: API Server, Scheduler, Controller Manager, and etcd. It does not run user workloads directly.

ðŸ“˜ [Control Plane Components â€“ Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components)

---

### **Worker Node**
A node that runs application Pods and is managed by the control plane. It contains the `kubelet`, a container runtime (e.g. CRI-O), and the `kube-proxy`.

ðŸ“˜ [Nodes â€“ Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/)

---

### **Infrastructure Node**
A node in OpenShift dedicated to running infrastructure-related workloads such as the router, registry, monitoring, or logging components. It is typically tainted to avoid scheduling regular application Pods.

---

### **SDN (Software-Defined Networking)**

### **Controller Manager**
A daemon that runs controllers in Kubernetes. Each controller watches the state of the cluster and makes changes to reach the desired state. Examples include Node Controller, ReplicaSet Controller, and Job Controller.

ðŸ“˜ [Controller Manager â€“ Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/)

---

### **Ingress**
An API object that defines rules for routing external HTTP(S) traffic to services within the cluster. It typically uses an Ingress Controller to handle the routing.

### **Volume**
A directory accessible to containers in a Pod, used for persistent or ephemeral data. Volumes outlive individual container restarts within a Pod.

ðŸ“˜ [Volumes â€“ Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)

---

### **Persistent Volume (PV)**
A piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using a StorageClass. PVs are used to persist data beyond the lifecycle of Pods.

ðŸ“˜ [Persistent Volumes â€“ Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)

---

### **Volume Binding (Docker/Podman context)**
In Docker or Podman, volume binding refers to the practice of mounting a host directory or volume into a container. This is used to persist data or provide configuration files from the host to the container.

ðŸ“˜ [Bind Mounts â€“ Docker](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)
ðŸ“˜ [Volumes â€“ Podman](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html#volume-v)

### **OVN-Kubernetes**
OVN-Kubernetes is the default CNI (Container Network Interface) plugin in OpenShift that provides a virtual networking layer using Open Virtual Network (OVN) to manage Pod-to-Pod, Pod-to-Service, and ingress/egress traffic. It supports advanced features like network policies, egress IPs, and dual-stack networking.
